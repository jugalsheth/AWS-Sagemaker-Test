I have tried to use AWS sagemaker to perform a usual classification Machine learning pipeline
boto3 is an important library to read sessions and compartments from AWS sagemaker and its inbuilt functions
get_image_uri used to get the inbuilt algorithms from sagemaker compartment 

Deleted the endpoints in the end to save on billing by Amazon
